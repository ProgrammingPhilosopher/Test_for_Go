# Project 4
## 1. Names of team members : Xu Liu, Markus Hou
##
## 2. Instructions on how to access an appropriate compiler/interpreter for my solver :
## 1) We are using Goland IDE to write and run our code.
## Here is the download link of Goland from jetbrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/go/
## 2) You can choose to download Mac/Linux/Windows version.
##
## 3. Instructions on how to use your solver :
## 1) Leave Module and Project path blank and set Global Path as the path of this project folder on your computer.
## 1) Simply run the func main(). There are two ways to run main():

## 2) then you can see that the message "Enter puzzle text file."
## 3) if you want to test a new sudoku, you can just put the text file into the project3-21 folder and type the name of the txt file. EX: sudoku-impossible.txt.
## 4) if you type nothing, then the solver will solve sudoku-test1 as default, and you will see the message "2022/12/02 20:37:06 stat : no such file or directory." as a reminder.
## 5) here are screenshots of our program solving two puzzles :
